# [Developer-Profile-Generator](https://github.com/ariehh1/Developer-Profile-Generator)

In the following command-line application, I've dynamically coded a PDF Github profile to appear locally upon user prompted input. When a user types in their Github username and favorite color, the PDF opens with certain user-based criteria. Inside the Terminal or Console, a user will first type "node index.js".

This portfolio made me think critically about generating documents on command. To have the most up to date and accurate information in the workplace is critical to one's success within a particular role. Test Driven Development, TDD, played a vital role in creating this application as I had to create multiple testing stages in order to ensure the PDF was generating correctly. One of the largest obstacles I had to overcome was understanding which pieces of information neeeded to be called from the overall API object. By console logging my object material, I was able to run my testing correctly and ensure a smooth user experience.
